List info about all or the specified block devices:
lsblk

To overwrite random data by 1s & 0s several times on the USB Drive:
sudo shred -v -n 1 /dev/{your_usb}

Install cryptsetup (Ubuntu has it installed by default):
sudo apt-get install cryptsetup

Set up a dm-crypt device in LUKS encryption mode and enter your secure passphrase:
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb

Open device and setup mapping with name provided (e.g. usb_d in this example):
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb usb_d

Verify the new virtual block device mapper:
ls -arlt /dev/mapper | tail

Run ext4 filesystem directly on that device:
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/mapper/USBDrive

Mount the device your filesystem:
sudo mount /dev/mapper/USBDrive /USBDrive

Verify the the mapper is properly mounted using the df command:
df -h /USBDrive/

Encryption Works!


On every reboot to mount and unmount a drive:

Mounting:
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb usb_d
sudo mount /dev/mapper/USBDrive /USBDrive

Unmounting:
sudo umount /USBDrive
sudo cryptsetup luksClose USBDrive
