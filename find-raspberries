All raspberry devices MAC addresses startvwith B8:27:EB.
So, on *nix systems:
sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/^Nmap/{ip=$NF}/B8:27:EB/{print ip}'
where 192.168.1.* will be your local network mask.

If you are on a Mac system you can use Homebrew to install nmap:
brew install nmap

On Windows, you might use Wireshark and use the following display filter:
eth.addr[0:3] == B8:27:EB
